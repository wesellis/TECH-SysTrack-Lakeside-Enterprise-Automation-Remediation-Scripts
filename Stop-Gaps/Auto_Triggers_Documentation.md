# SysTrack Automation Auto Triggers Documentation

## Overview
This document tracks automation triggers that should be automatically executed based on specific system conditions or thresholds.

**Created**: July 1, 2025  
**Author**: SysTrack Automation Team  
**Purpose**: Document auto-trigger conditions for Stop-Gap automations

## Auto Trigger Configurations

### M365 Teams Cache Cleanup
**Automation**: `M365_Teams_ClearCache`

**Auto Trigger Conditions**:
- Teams cache size exceeds 500MB (High Priority)
- Teams cache size exceeds 200MB (Medium Priority)
- Multiple Teams processes not responding
- IndexedDB corruption detected
- Teams application crashes more than 2 times in 24 hours
- Memory usage per Teams process exceeds 500MB
- Cache files older than 30 days exceed 100 files

**Trigger Frequency**: 
- High Priority: Immediate execution
- Medium Priority: Execute during maintenance window
- Preventive: Weekly scan and cleanup if thresholds met

**Dependencies**:
- Teams process must be stoppable
- User context required
- Backup capabilities available

### Windows Cisco Umbrella Service Management
**Automation**: `Windows_CiscoUmbrella_RestartService`

**Auto Trigger Conditions**:
- Cisco Umbrella service stopped or failed state
- DNS resolution failures to umbrella.cisco.com
- Umbrella agent not responding to heartbeat checks
- Network policy enforcement failures detected
- Service startup type changed from Automatic
- Registry corruption in Umbrella configuration
- Certificate validation failures for Umbrella endpoints

**Trigger Frequency**:
- Critical: Immediate execution for service failures
- Monitoring: Every 15 minutes during business hours
- Validation: Post-remediation checks every 5 minutes for 1 hour

**Dependencies**:
- Administrative privileges required
- Network connectivity to Cisco Umbrella infrastructure
- Local security policy compliance
- Certificate store accessibility

**Special Considerations**:
- Coordinate with network security team
- Verify corporate firewall exceptions
- Maintain audit trail for compliance
- Escalate persistent failures to NOC

## Trigger Implementation Notes

### Common Trigger Mechanisms
1. **Performance Counters**: WMI-based monitoring for resource usage
2. **Event Log Monitoring**: Windows Event Log analysis for error patterns
3. **Registry Monitoring**: Configuration drift detection
4. **Process Monitoring**: Service state and responsiveness checks
5. **Network Connectivity**: Endpoint reachability validation
6. **File System Monitoring**: Cache size and corruption detection

### Escalation Procedures
- **Level 1**: Automatic remediation attempt
- **Level 2**: Scheduled retry with extended logging
- **Level 3**: Manual intervention notification
- **Level 4**: NOC/Help Desk escalation

### Logging Requirements
- All auto-trigger events logged to Windows Event Log
- SysTrack automation execution tracking
- Health clinic integration for trend analysis
- Performance metrics collection for optimization

## Future Auto Trigger Additions

### Planned Automations with Auto Triggers
1. **Browser Cache Management**: Size-based triggers for Chrome/Edge cleanup
2. **SCCM Client Health**: Policy compliance and communication failures
3. **Windows Update Service**: Service state and update failure patterns
4. **Office 365 Authentication**: Token expiration and credential issues
5. **VPN Client Management**: Connection failures and certificate issues

### Integration Points
- **SysTrack Monitoring**: Native integration with existing monitoring rules
- **Health Clinic System**: Automated follow-up and trend tracking
- **ITSM Integration**: Ticket creation for persistent issues
- **Compliance Reporting**: Automated documentation for audit trails

## Trigger Configuration Examples

### Teams Cache Trigger (PowerShell)
```powershell
# Example trigger condition check
$teamsCacheSize = (Get-ChildItem "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Microsoft\Teams" -Recurse -File | 
                   Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum).Sum / 1MB

if ($teamsCacheSize -gt 500) {
    # Execute M365_Teams_ClearCache automation
    Start-Process -FilePath "PowerShell.exe" -ArgumentList "-File 'Remediate_M365_Teams_ClearCache.ps1'" -WindowStyle Hidden
}
```

### Cisco Umbrella Service Trigger (PowerShell)
```powershell
# Example service state monitoring
$umbrellaService = Get-Service "Umbrella_Agent" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

if ($umbrellaService.Status -ne "Running") {
    # Execute Windows_CiscoUmbrella_RestartService automation
    Start-Process -FilePath "PowerShell.exe" -ArgumentList "-File 'Remediate_Windows_CiscoUmbrella_RestartService.ps1'" -WindowStyle Hidden
}
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Success Metrics
- Trigger accuracy rate (true positives vs false positives)
- Remediation success rate per trigger type
- Mean time to resolution (MTTR) improvement
- Reduction in manual intervention requirements

### Alert Conditions
- Auto-trigger execution failures
- Repeated trigger activations (potential systemic issues)
- Remediation failure patterns
- Performance degradation after auto-remediation

### Reporting
- Daily summary of auto-trigger activations
- Weekly trend analysis of trigger patterns
- Monthly effectiveness review and optimization
- Quarterly trigger configuration updates

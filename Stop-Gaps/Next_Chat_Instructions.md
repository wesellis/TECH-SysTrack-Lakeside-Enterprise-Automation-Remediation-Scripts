- **Progress**: 9 of 15 SCCM automations complete (60.0%)

## Your Mission
Continue systematic SCCM Management Group development with **SCCM_Client_SetSite**, maintaining hyper-professional standards with no emojis, comprehensive error handling, and enterprise-grade code quality focused on SCCM client site assignment operations.

## IMMEDIATE NEXT TASK
**CREATE SCCM_Client_SetSite** - Complete SCCM client site assignment automation
1. **Detection**: Analyze current site assignment status, validate site configuration, assess assignment need, and verify site accessibility
2. **Remediation**: Execute SCCM client site assignment operations with site validation, assignment procedures, and configuration verification
3. **Follow-up**: Validate site assignment completion, verify site communication, and confirm operational readiness

## Folder Structure Required
Each automation must have its own folder with exactly 3 PowerShell files:
```
Stop-Gaps/SCCM_Client_SetSite/
  â”œâ”€â”€ Detect_SCCM_Client_SetSite.ps1
  â”œâ”€â”€ Remediate_SCCM_Client_SetSite.ps1
  â””â”€â”€ FollowUp_SCCM_Client_SetSite.ps1
```

## Script Requirements

### Technical Standards
- PowerShell 5.1 compatibility
- UTF-8 encoding with BOM
- Windows (CRLF) line endings
- NO EMOJIS - professional text only
- Comprehensive try-catch error handling
- Windows Event Log integration
- SysTrack-compatible structured output
- Appropriate exit codes (0=success, 1=failure, 2=partial)

### SCCM Client Site Assignment Specific Requirements
The SCCM Client Site Assignment automation requires:
- **Site Status Analysis**: Current site assignment validation, site code verification, and assignment need assessment
- **Site Assignment Operations**: SCCM client site assignment execution with site validation and assignment procedures
- **Site Configuration**: Site code management, site boundary verification, and configuration validation
- **Assignment Validation**: Post-assignment verification, site communication testing, and operational confirmation
- **Health Integration**: Structured output for monitoring systems and health clinic integration

### Established SCCM Patterns to Follow
Apply the proven patterns from completed SCCM automations:
- **WMI Operations**: Use SCCM-specific WMI classes and methods for site assignment operations
- **Client Management**: Comprehensive SCCM client site assignment coordination and validation
- **Error Resilience**: Handle SCCM-specific error conditions and assignment timeout scenarios
- **Progress Tracking**: Implement comprehensive logging and progress reporting
- **Health Integration**: Structured output compatible with health clinic systems

## SCCM_Client_SetSite Focus Areas
- **Site Assignment Analysis**: Evaluate current site assignment status and assignment requirements
- **Site Code Validation**: Verify target site codes, site accessibility, and boundary configuration
- **Assignment Execution**: Execute controlled SCCM client site assignment operations
- **Site Communication**: Test site communication capabilities and management point connectivity
- **Assignment Confirmation**: Verify successful site assignment and operational readiness

## Next Priority Work Order After SetSite
**SCCM_Client_SftwrMeteringRptCycle** - SCCM software metering reporting cycle automation
Focus: Software metering data collection and reporting operations

**REMAINING SCCM Management** (6 automations after SetSite):
   - SCCM_Client_SftwrMeteringRptCycle
   - SCCM_Client_SftwrUpdateAssgnmtEval
   - SCCM_Client_SoftwareInventoryCycle
   - SCCM_Client_SoftwareUpdateScanCycle
   - SCCM_Client_StateMessageRefresh
   - SCCM_Client_UserPolicyEvaluationCycle

## Success Criteria
- All SCCM scripts must handle site assignment operations gracefully
- Integration with SCCM client site infrastructure and assignment methodologies
- Support for various SCCM site configuration scenarios
- Professional documentation for SCCM administrators
- Ready for enterprise SCCM environment deployment

## Working Approach
1. **FIRST**: Create SCCM_Client_SetSite (Detection, Remediation, Follow-up)
2. **THEN**: Continue with SCCM_Client_SftwrMeteringRptCycle
3. Maintain systematic SCCM automation development
4. Focus on site-based SCCM client assignment operations and error handling
5. Build upon established SCCM automation patterns

# Optimize slow startup systems
Fix-SlowStartupSystems.ps1
  - Threshold: >60 seconds startup time
  - Actions: Startup program cleanup, boot optimization

# Improve login performance
Optimize-LoginPerformance.ps1
  - Threshold: Login time >2 minutes
  - Actions: Profile cleanup, authentication optimization
```

### **4. Performance Baseline Monitoring**
**Data Source:** `groupbycpuaveragelog.csv`

**Baseline Thresholds:**
- CPU Average Logged In: Monitor for >80% of baseline
- Memory Average Logged In: Monitor for >90% of baseline
- Automated alerts for systems outside normal ranges

**Script Opportunities:**
```powershell
# Baseline deviation detection
Monitor-PerformanceBaselines.ps1
  - Compare current metrics vs. established baselines
  - Alert on significant deviations (>20% above normal)
  - Automatic remediation for common issues
```

### **5. Browser Performance Optimization**
**Data Source:** `websitebypagefocust.csv`

**Insights:**
- Top 500 websites by user engagement time
- Browser performance patterns
- Web application resource consumption

**Script Opportunities:**
```powershell
# Browser optimization for heavy users
Optimize-BrowserPerformance.ps1
  - Clear browser caches for high-usage sites
  - Optimize browser settings for performance
  - Manage browser extensions and plugins
```

### **6. Risk-Based Automation Prioritization**
**Data Source:** `groupbylowriskmedium.csv`

**Risk Categories:**
- Low Risk: Stable systems, maintenance automation
- Medium Risk: Preventive care, monitoring scripts  
- High Risk: Immediate intervention, comprehensive remediation

**Script Opportunities:**
```powershell
# High-risk system intervention
Remediate-HighRiskSystems.ps1
  - Priority automation for systems in High Risk category
  - Comprehensive health checks and fixes

# Preventive maintenance for medium-risk
Maintain-MediumRiskSystems.ps1
  - Scheduled maintenance scripts
  - Performance optimization before issues develop
```

## üìà **Data-Driven Script Development Guidelines**

### **Performance Thresholds (Based on Actual Data)**

#### **CPU Usage Thresholds:**
- **Normal:** <50% average CPU during logged-in time
- **Elevated:** 50-70% average CPU during logged-in time  
- **High:** 70-85% average CPU during logged-in time
- **Critical:** >85% average CPU during logged-in time

#### **Memory Usage Thresholds:**
- **Normal:** <4GB average memory during logged-in time
- **Elevated:** 4-6GB average memory during logged-in time
- **High:** 6-8GB average memory during logged-in time  
- **Critical:** >8GB average memory during logged-in time

#### **Health Score Intervention Points:**
- **Excellent (90-100%):** Monitoring only, no intervention
- **Good (80-89%):** Preventive maintenance scripts
- **Fair (60-79%):** Active optimization scripts
- **Poor (<60%):** Immediate comprehensive remediation

#### **Startup Performance Thresholds:**
- **Excellent:** <30 seconds startup time
- **Good:** 30-45 seconds startup time
- **Fair:** 45-60 seconds startup time
- **Poor:** >60 seconds startup time

### **Application-Specific Automation Rules**

#### **High-Priority Applications for Automation:**
1. **Microsoft Office Suite** - Memory leak detection and restart
2. **Web Browsers** - Cache management and performance optimization  
3. **Citrix/VDI Applications** - Session optimization and connectivity
4. **Security Software** - Performance impact minimization
5. **Background Services** - Resource usage optimization

#### **Automation Trigger Conditions:**
- **Application CPU >30%** for >10 minutes continuously
- **Application Memory >2GB** and growing trend detected  
- **Application Not Responding** for >60 seconds
- **Application Crash Pattern** detected (>3 crashes in 24 hours)

## üõ†Ô∏è **Implementation Recommendations**

### **Phase 1: Health Score Automation (Week 1-2)**
1. Create scripts targeting Poor health score systems (highest impact)
2. Focus on systems with hardware problems and system faults
3. Implement productivity impact reduction automation

### **Phase 2: Application Performance (Week 3-4)**  
1. Target top 50 CPU-intensive applications from data
2. Implement memory leak detection for problem applications
3. Create application restart/optimization workflows

### **Phase 3: User Experience (Week 5-6)**
1. Address slow startup systems using actual performance data
2. Optimize login times for affected user groups
3. Implement browser performance optimization

### **Phase 4: Monitoring & Baselines (Week 7-8)**
1. Establish monitoring based on actual baseline data
2. Create deviation detection and automatic remediation
3. Implement risk-based automation prioritization

## üìã **Script Development Checklist**

### **For Each New Script:**
- [ ] **Reference actual data thresholds** from SysTrack metrics
- [ ] **Target specific systems/groups** identified in the data
- [ ] **Use realistic performance baselines** based on environment data
- [ ] **Implement data-driven decision logic** (not arbitrary thresholds)
- [ ] **Include metrics collection** to measure script effectiveness
- [ ] **Test against known problem systems** identified in the data

### **Data Integration Points:**
- [ ] **Health.csv** - System health targeting
- [ ] **People.csv** - User experience metrics  
- [ ] **Software Packages.csv** - Application-specific automation
- [ ] **Performance baselines** - Threshold determination
- [ ] **Risk categories** - Automation prioritization

# Daily Endpoint Health Improvement Plan - Mike Flanagan Initiative
*Created: July 1, 2025*

## Current Health Status (Baseline)
- **Critical**: 534 endpoints
- **Poor**: 276 endpoints  
- **Good**: 1853 endpoints
- **Total Endpoints**: 2663
- **Health Score**: 69.6% (Good endpoints / Total endpoints)

## Daily Health Tracking Requirements

### What Mike Flanagan Wants to See Daily:
1. **Coming ON to Good Health**
   - Endpoints moving from Critical → Poor → Good
   - Daily count of endpoints improving
   - Root causes of improvements (automations, manual fixes, etc.)

2. **Coming OFF Good Health** 
   - Endpoints dropping from Good → Poor → Critical
   - Daily count of degrading endpoints
   - Root causes of degradation (new issues, failed updates, etc.)

## Recommended Daily Tracking Dashboard

### Daily Health Movement Report
```
Date: [Current Date]
Previous Day Health: Good: X | Poor: Y | Critical: Z
Current Day Health:  Good: X | Poor: Y | Critical: Z

IMPROVEMENTS (Coming ON):
✅ Critical → Poor: X endpoints
✅ Critical → Good: X endpoints  
✅ Poor → Good: X endpoints
Total Improved: X endpoints

DEGRADATIONS (Coming OFF):
❌ Good → Poor: X endpoints
❌ Good → Critical: X endpoints
❌ Poor → Critical: X endpoints
Total Degraded: X endpoints

NET CHANGE: +/- X endpoints toward Good health
```

### Key Metrics to Track Daily:
1. **Net Health Change**: Daily improvement/degradation count
2. **Health Velocity**: Rate of change in each category
3. **Top Improving Sites**: Locations with best health gains
4. **Top Degrading Sites**: Locations needing attention
5. **Automation Impact**: Health changes driven by SysTrack automations

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Data Collection (Week 1)
- Export daily health data from FLO Insights
- Create baseline tracking spreadsheet
- Identify data export automation possibilities

### Phase 2: Automated Tracking (Week 2-3)
- Set up automated daily exports
- Create PowerBI/Excel dashboard for daily tracking
- Implement change detection algorithms

### Phase 3: Proactive Management (Week 4+)
- Identify patterns in health degradation
- Create predictive alerts for potential issues
- Implement automated remediation triggers

## Daily Action Items for Health Improvement

### Morning Review (9 AM):
1. Review overnight health changes
2. Identify critical degradations requiring immediate attention
3. Assign remediation tasks for critical issues
4. Review automation success from previous day

### Midday Check (1 PM):
1. Monitor real-time health changes
2. Address any new critical issues
3. Verify morning remediation efforts are working

### End of Day Summary (5 PM):
1. Generate daily health movement report
2. Document successful improvement strategies
3. Plan next day's improvement targets
4. Update Mike Flanagan with daily summary

## Automation Integration

### SysTrack Automations Contributing to Health:
- **Browser Cache Clearing**: Resolves browsing/performance issues
- **Windows Updates**: Ensures patch compliance
- **Disk Cleanup**: Improves system performance
- **Service Restarts**: Restores functionality
- **License Activation**: Resolves compliance issues

### Target Improvements Through Automation:
1. **Increase Self-Help Success Rate**: Currently 65% in May
2. **Reduce Manual Resolver Interventions**: Focus on preventive automations
3. **Faster Issue Resolution**: Reduce time from detection to fix

## Success Metrics

### Daily Targets:
- **Net Positive Health Movement**: +5 endpoints per day minimum
- **Critical Reduction**: -2 critical endpoints per day
- **Good Health Growth**: +3 good endpoints per day
- **Zero Same-Day Degradation**: Prevent good endpoints from becoming critical same day

### Weekly Targets:
- **Overall Health Score Improvement**: +2% per week
- **Critical Endpoint Reduction**: -10% per week
- **Automation Success Rate**: Maintain >70% self-help resolution

### Monthly Goals:
- **Critical Endpoints**: Reduce from 534 to <400
- **Poor Endpoints**: Reduce from 276 to <200  
- **Good Endpoints**: Increase from 1853 to >2000
- **Overall Health Score**: Improve from 69.6% to >75%

## Reporting Structure

```

### Weekly Executive Summary:
- Week-over-week health trend analysis
- Top contributing factors to improvements/degradations
- ROI of automation investments
- Recommendations for next week's focus areas

## Tools and Resources Needed

### Technical Requirements:
1. **Automated FLO Data Export**: Daily CSV/API export
2. **Change Detection Scripts**: Compare daily snapshots
3. **Dashboard Creation**: PowerBI or Excel-based tracking
4. **Alert System**: Notifications for significant changes
5. **Integration**: Connect with SysTrack automation metrics

### Process Requirements:
1. **Daily Review Schedule**: Consistent timing for reviews
2. **Escalation Procedures**: When to involve additional resources
3. **Documentation Standards**: Consistent change logging
4. **Success Celebration**: Recognize teams achieving health improvements

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week):
1. Begin daily manual tracking using FLO exports
2. Create baseline tracking spreadsheet
3. Establish daily review meeting with Mike Flanagan
4. Document current improvement/degradation patterns

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks):
1. Automate data collection process
2. Create dynamic dashboard for real-time tracking
3. Integrate SysTrack automation success metrics
4. Establish KPI targets and accountability

### Long-term (Next Month):
1. Implement predictive health analytics
2. Create automated remediation workflows
3. Establish health improvement best practices
4. Scale successful strategies across all regions
